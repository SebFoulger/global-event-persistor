Note that the fake news classification model is not especially reliable. Upon the training data it has 88% accuracy, but the transferrence of the model to random news articles means that we don't know about the likelihood of a prediction being correct. Currently the model only takes into account titles, which clearly has limitations. This model could be altered to include the text from the article but this would require a lot of training.  
The training of the model is localised to training.py and used the files `True.csv` and `Fake.csv`. As long as the function `news_classification` takes a list of entries and returns a list of fake news predictions using a `1` for fake news, a `0` for real news, and a `-1` for unkown.
